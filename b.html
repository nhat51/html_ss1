<p>The Internet is a network of networks. That is, computer networks are linked to other
    networks, spanning countries. The TCP/IP transfer protocol provides the bindings that
    connect all these computers the world over.</p>

<p>A web page is not a printed page. That is, the guidelines that are applied to print may not
    apply to a web page. Avoid making the reader scan too much of the screen while reading the
    page. After a while it puts a strain on the eyes, and the reader may lose interest. Text should
    be contained within a few inches width.</p>

<p>Linear layout follows a linear structure. There is a sequential link between the pages. Each
    page has a link to the previous and next page. The last page has a link to the first page. This
    format is used when you are presenting sequential information. For example, chapters of a
    book or slides of a presentation which require the user to read the information in sequential order.</p>
